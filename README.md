LinkQuery, also known as LINQ (Language Integrated Query), is a set of language extensions that allow developers to query data from different data sources, including databases, XML documents, and objects in memory, using a uniform syntax in C#. LINQ provides a more intuitive and type-safe way to query data compared to traditional query methods.

With LINQ, developers can write queries using familiar language constructs such as foreach loops, conditional statements, and lambda expressions. These queries are then translated into a series of method calls against the underlying data source, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

In addition to querying data, LINQ also provides support for inserting, updating, and deleting data in data sources. This makes it a powerful tool for data access and manipulation in C# applications.

Overall, LINQ simplifies data access and manipulation in C# by providing a consistent, type-safe, and intuitive syntax for querying and manipulating data from different data sources.
